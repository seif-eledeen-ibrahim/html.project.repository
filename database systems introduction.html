<h2>What is a Database?</h2> 
<h3>     <img src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Database-What-is-a-Database-Edureka-159x180.png" alt="img3">
    The database is an organized collection of structured data to make it easily
     accessible, manageable and update. In simple words, you can say, a database 
     in a place where the data is stored. The best analogy is the library.
    The library contains a huge collection of books of different genres, 
    here the library is database and books are the data. In layman terms, 
    consider your school registry. All the details of the students are entered
     in a single file. You get the details regarding the students in this file.
     This is called a Database where you can access the information of any student.</h3>
